  abstract        = {-methyladenosine (m A) is one of the most abundant messenger RNA modifications in eukaryotes involved in various pivotal processes of RNA metabolism. The most popular high-throughput m A identification method depends on the anti-m A antibody but suffers from poor reproducibility and limited resolution. Exact location information is of great value for understanding the dynamics, machinery, and functions of m A. Here, we developed a precise and high-throughput antibody-independent m A identification method based on the m A-sensitive RNA endoribonuclease recognizing ACA motif (m A-sensitive RNA-Endoribonuclease-Facilitated sequencing or m A-REF-seq). Whole-transcriptomic, single-base m A maps generated by m A-REF-seq quantitatively displayed an explicit distribution pattern with enrichment near stop codons. We used independent methods to validate methylation status and abundance of individual m A sites, confirming the high reliability and accuracy of m A-REF-seq. We applied this method on five tissues from human, mouse, and rat, showing that m A sites are conserved with single-nucleotide specificity and tend to cluster among species.},

  abstract        = {N6-methyladenosine (m A) is the most abundant modification on mRNA and is implicated in critical roles in development, physiology, and disease. A major limitation has been the inability to quantify m A stoichiometry and the lack of antibody-independent methodologies for interrogating m A. Here, we develop MAZTER-seq for systematic quantitative profiling of m6A at single-nucleotide resolution at 16%-25% of expressed sites, building on differential cleavage by an RNase. MAZTER-seq permits validation and de novo discovery of m A sites, calibration of the performance of antibody-based approaches, and quantitative tracking of m A dynamics in yeast gametogenesis and mammalian differentiation. We discover that m6A stoichiometry is "hard coded" in cis via a simple and predictable code, accounting for 33%-46% of the variability in methylation levels and allowing accurate prediction of m A loss and acquisition events across evolution. MAZTER-seq allows quantitative investigation of m A regulation in subcellular fractions, diverse cell types, and disease states.},

This allows for the generation of a comprehensive atlas of distinct methylomes uniquely mediated by every individual known methyltransferase or demethylase. Our atlas reveals METTL16 to indirectly impact manifold methylation targets beyond its consensus target motif and highlights the importance of precision in mapping PCIF1-dependent m6Am. Rather than reverse RNA methylation, we find that both ALKBH5 and FTO instead maintain their regulated sites in an unmethylated steady-state. In FTO’s absence, anomalous m6Am disrupts snRNA interaction with nuclear export machinery, potentially causing aberrant pre-mRNA splicing events.},

            N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal RNA modification in eukaryotic mRNAs and influences many aspects of RNA processing. miCLIP (m6A individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) is an antibody-based approach to map m6A sites with single-nucleotide resolution. However, due to broad antibody reactivity, reliable identification of m6A sites from miCLIP data remains challenging. Here, we present miCLIP2 in combination with machine learning to significantly improve m6A detection. The optimized miCLIP2 results in high-complexity libraries from less input material. Importantly, we established a robust computational pipeline to tackle the inherent issue of false positives in antibody-based m6A detection. The analyses were calibrated with Mettl3 knockout cells to learn the characteristics of m6A deposition, including m6A sites outside of DRACH motifs. To make our results universally applicable, we trained a machine learning model, m6Aboost, based on the experimental and RNA sequence features. Importantly, m6Aboost allows prediction of genuine m6A sites in miCLIP2 data without filtering for DRACH motifs or the need for Mettl3 depletion. Using m6Aboost, we identify thousands of high-confidence m6A sites in different murine and human cell lines, which provide a rich resource for future analysis. Collectively, our combined experimental and computational methodology greatly improves m6A identification.},
