  abstract        = {-methyladenosine (m A) is one of the most abundant messenger RNA modifications in eukaryotes involved in various pivotal processes of RNA metabolism. The most popular high-throughput m A identification method depends on the anti-m A antibody but suffers from poor reproducibility and limited resolution. Exact location information is of great value for understanding the dynamics, machinery, and functions of m A. Here, we developed a precise and high-throughput antibody-independent m A identification method based on the m A-sensitive RNA endoribonuclease recognizing ACA motif (m A-sensitive RNA-Endoribonuclease-Facilitated sequencing or m A-REF-seq). Whole-transcriptomic, single-base m A maps generated by m A-REF-seq quantitatively displayed an explicit distribution pattern with enrichment near stop codons. We used independent methods to validate methylation status and abundance of individual m A sites, confirming the high reliability and accuracy of m A-REF-seq. We applied this method on five tissues from human, mouse, and rat, showing that m A sites are conserved with single-nucleotide specificity and tend to cluster among species.},

  abstract        = {N6-methyladenosine (m A) is the most abundant modification on mRNA and is implicated in critical roles in development, physiology, and disease. A major limitation has been the inability to quantify m A stoichiometry and the lack of antibody-independent methodologies for interrogating m A. Here, we develop MAZTER-seq for systematic quantitative profiling of m6A at single-nucleotide resolution at 16%-25% of expressed sites, building on differential cleavage by an RNase. MAZTER-seq permits validation and de novo discovery of m A sites, calibration of the performance of antibody-based approaches, and quantitative tracking of m A dynamics in yeast gametogenesis and mammalian differentiation. We discover that m6A stoichiometry is "hard coded" in cis via a simple and predictable code, accounting for 33%-46% of the variability in methylation levels and allowing accurate prediction of m A loss and acquisition events across evolution. MAZTER-seq allows quantitative investigation of m A regulation in subcellular fractions, diverse cell types, and disease states.},
