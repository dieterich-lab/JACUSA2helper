\title{Subset of RRDs detected by JACUSA2 in HEK-293 ADAR KD and untreated cells}
\format{a tibble with 19 elements:
\itemize{
	\item contig: Character string representing the contig of the variant
	\item start: Numeric position of variant (>=0)
	\item end: Numeric corresponds to "start + 1"
	\item name: Character string. Currently, name of used method (\emph{call-\{1,2\}}, \emph{pileup}, \emph{rt-arrest}, or \emph{lrt-arrest})
	\item score: Numeric value representing the test-statistc. Higher values indicate more divergent pileups
	\item strand: Character representing strand information; "+", "-", or "."(no strand information available)
	\item info: Character string separated with ";" provding additional data for this specific site. Empty field is equal to "*"
	\item filter: ","-separated character string showing feature filter information. Empty field is equal to "*"
	\item ref: Character "A", "C", "G", "T", or "N" representing the reference base for this site - inverted when strand is "-".
	\item base_type: Character string inndicating what type of base calls are shown. Here: "total".
	\item condition: Numeric value: "1"(here: ADAR KD) or "2"(here: unreated)
	\item replicate: Numeric value: "1" or "2" for all conditions
	\item bc_A: Numeric value representing base call count for A
	\item bc_C: Numeric value representing base call count for C
	\item bc_G: Numeric value representing base call count for G
	\item bc_T: Numeric value representing base call count for T
	\item bc: Observed base calls for this site. Combination of: "A", "C", "G", and "T"
   \item cov: Numeric value indicating the read coverage for this site
